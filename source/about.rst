pyiron is an integrated development environment for implementing, testing, and running simulations in computational materials science. It combines several tools in a common plattform:

• Atomic structure objects – compatible to the `Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/>`_.

• Atomistic simulation codes – like `LAMMPS <http://lammps.sandia.gov>`_ and `VASP <https://www.vasp.at>`_.

• Feedback Loops – to construct dynamic simulation life cycles.

• Hierarchical data management – interfacing with storage resources like SQL and `HDF5 <https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>`_.

• Integrated visualization – based on `NGLview <https://github.com/arose/nglview>`_. 

• Interactive simulation protocols - based on `Jupyter notebooks <http://jupyter.org>`_.

• Object oriented job management – for scaling complex simulation protocols from single jobs to high-throughput simulations.

pyiron (called pyron) is developed in the `Computational Materials Design department <https://www.mpie.de/CM>`_ of `Joerg Neugebauer <https://www.mpie.de/person/43010/2763386>`_ at the `Max Planck Insitut für Eisenforschung (Max Planck Insitute for iron research) <https://www.mpie.de/2281/en>`_. While its original focus was to provide a framework to develop and run complex simulation protocols as needed for ab initio thermodynamics it quickly evolved into a versatile tool to manage a wide variety of simulation tasks. In 2016 the `Interdisciplinary Centre for Advanced Materials Simulation (ICAMS) <http://www.icams.de>`_ joined the development of the framework with a specific focus on high throughput applications. In 2018 pyiron was released as open-source project.
